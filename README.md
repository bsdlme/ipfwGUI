# ipfwGUI
#### A very simple GUI for the ipfw packet filter (AKA firewall) for FreeBSD

With ipfwGUI it is possible to create a "workstation" type [firewall](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?firewall) and allow incoming traffic to your host.
The ports to be allowed can be only be selected from a list of ports in LISTEN status for now. You need to start the listening daemon before you start ipfwGUI.
